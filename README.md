# Repo1

Build an outfit from a series of retailers such as Myer, David Jones etc, and display on a mannequin.

## Installation

Apart of more obvious dependencies, remaining ones related to geometry as well as image display.
 - PIL
 - math
 - flask
 - io

## How to run

After git clone, launch from the '''repo1''' folder:
```
python3 app.py
```

To add more outfits, add pictures in the '''./static''' folder. For each one, a line in '''./index''' also needs to be added.

## Further work

- Add a better mannequin
- Contour analysis for mannequin and stretch clothing to fit
- Remove '''./static''' folder and add outfits from scraping clothing websites
- Add machine learning section for recommendations
